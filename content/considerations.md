<!--
## Science
Any science that the students describe should be based in reality. Weâ€™re asking students to consider technology that will likely become available five to ten years from now. Has the team demonstrated that trends in current science indicate that their vision will be possible?

## Suitability
What makes a biotechnological solution the best method to address this problem, as opposed to other technologies or social solutions? Has the team considered why a biological design is the right fit for the problem?

## Compatibility
How does this vision fit into already-built systems? Does it require an entirely new infrastructure to be built along with it?

Microbes usually bring thoughts of sickness and disease. Our research showed us that these tiny creatures inhabit a fascinating world. We realized that exposing their interactions could make these invisible creatures as exciting as the animals that roam the African Savannah. We designed a themed venue to explore this dynamic ecology obscured by scale.

The challenge was to present the microscopic world in a way that would be accessible, coherent, and engaging to guests. What kinds of struggles do microbes have? What kinds of hierarchies exist? How do they relate to one another? Could we experience microbial worlds without microscopes? How might Microbial Gardens present this world?

We decided that the best way to see the "ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms" described by Dr. Joshua Lederer would be to foreground the interactions between microscopic species. Our first strategy was to separate the species into six park pavilions and provide pathways of information and resource communication. We called this place Microbial Gardens acknowledging The Poison Garden in Alnwick, Northumberland (England), The Huntington in San Marino, and Epcot Center.

We designed an environment that makes the microbial world easy to observe, comprehend, and finally to embrace the communities of microscopic interactions. Microbial Gardens presents aggregates of microbial interactions at human scale.  We reduced microscopic interactions to key actors: Diatoms, Radiolaria, Rotifers, and Copepods. We focussed on the food chain: their relations with one another, and how energy flows between them.

The Gardens are organized in a classic base structure with minor attractions that highlight the actors in this ecology. Interactions between the microbes and guests shape the pathways connecting the pavilions.

Microbial Gardens is interactive: the park changes from visit to visit. Guests carry resources between pavilions and contribute to ebbs and flows of foods and contaminants. Carnivorous microbes may hitch rides on guests and prey on other microbes. So guests make visible impacts this microscopic worlds. These authentic interactions are unique to Microbial Gardens, and we feel that seeing these effects will increase engagement and generate sympathy for the tiny creatures and environments all around.

We acknowledge previous work by Neri Oxman and the Meditated Matter group at MIT that explores the relationship between biology and engineering. The combination of biology and engineering reveals the perplexing charm of microbes, and we hope that our guests will leave with a new appreciation for the symbiosis between microbes and humans.
