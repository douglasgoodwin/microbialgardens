Nobel Prize recipient Joshua Lederberg coined the term *microbiome* to describe "the ecological community of commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space.‚Äù We are attracted to a concept of self that includes otherness; we wished to investigate this other and share our findings.

We wanted to celebrate the macrobiotic ecology: its species interactions, food webs, and communities of cells and microbes and display this drama on a human scale.

We were inspired by Epcot Center, the Alnwick Poison Gardens, and biological morphogenesis.
