Microbial Gardens is a place where the invisible becomes visible. Scientists estimate that microbes outnumber human cells by nearly 30%. Microbial Gardens amplifies microbial interactions so you can see just how dynamic the microbial world can be.

Stroll among these living pavilions as they compete with the others for resources. See how some gently provide sustenance for others just as grasses provide nourishment to deer. Then see how others prey upon them to satisfy their needs. The pavilions support microbes on a human scale, and each hosts a different species. Connections provide access to visitors and promote flows of resources between them.

Guests help to shape the Gardens. Energy from footsteps activate LEDs that foster growth. Also, the Gardens may direct traffic by sending luminescent microbes into areas that would benefit from the traffic. This dramatic ecology is here for all to see at Microbial Gardens.
